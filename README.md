## Running
You can choose to run any of the two (produce or consume) tasks using the following command:


```
rcc run --task "Consume data"
```

or

```
rcc run --task "Produce data"
```

If you want to run both, just type:
```
rcc run
```

If you want to run the bots using the env variables, just type:
```
rcc run -e devdata/env.json
```

Both tasks are defined on the **robot.yaml** configuration file.
